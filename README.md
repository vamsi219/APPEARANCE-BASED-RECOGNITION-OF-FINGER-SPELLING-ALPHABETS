# APPEARANCE-BASED-RECOGNITION-OF-FINGER-SPELLING-ALPHABETS
Study On research Paper based on the same , and developed a ML model based on the overview of the paper.

In this paper, a study on PCA based model, for the purpose of  recognising fingerspelling (sign language) alphabets is done. Its  recognition performance on a large and varied real time dataset is  analysed. For increasing the performance of this PCA model, some pre processing operations were also made in both training and testing/recognition phases. An exhaustive experiment conducted on a  large number of fingerspelling alphabet images taken from 20 different  individuals in real environment has revealed that the suggested pre processing has a drastic impact in improving the performance of a  conventional PCA based model. 

Automatic sign language recognition has huge significance and  applications in everyday world. It helps in integration of people with  voice and hearing disability to communicate and interact with the others.  Sign language recognition is being actively pursued by the research  community around the world. Many works are already been done in this  field using HMM, artificial neural networks and some works are done  with the help of Bayesian theory. But there are some drawbacks in all  the works like we need cyber gloves for feature extraction purpose but  those are expensive. And some methods are failed when we took the  data from more than single user, and also put some restrictions on the  user and the environment like the background should be only black so  that the method gives high recognition rates. All the approaches were  made in image processing for feature extraction. Some appearance based methodologies were used in the field of face recognition using a  statistical technique called PCA. We can use these appearance-based  methods for sign language recognition also. Because there are so many  types in PCA like 2D-PCA, (2D)2-PCA and Diagonal PCA which gives  better recognition rates. Some research was done using PCA in sign  language recognition and gave some good results. But the model  performed well we took the data from 2 or less people, in the other cases  it failed. Also, it as a restriction that the user should have plain black  background. We want make a PCA algorithm that overcome these  problems. 

In this paper, a PCA algorithm using standard image processing  techniques is explored. Image processing methods like smoothing and  contrast enhancement of the images are applied before using them in  training and recognition phases. So that we can get a better approach to  increase the performance of the appearance-based methodology of using  PCA. No restrictions on the user and the environment are imposed  except that of a plain background. In fact, the proposed method  overcomes the reduced performance of PCA due to its usage in general  environment. A large dataset created by capturing 24 fingerspelling  alphabets made by 20 users, with 6 samples of each alphabet, resulting  in 2880 signs and experiments were done on this dataset to identify the  accuracy of the model. Out of 26 alphabets we take only 24 alphabets  for dataset the alphabets ‘j’ and ‘z’ are dynamic signs consisting of hand  movement and thus, only static signs are considered in this work.  Experiments show that the proposed image processing methodology  gives better results compared to conventional PCA. The data is divided  into train data and test data. Out of the 6 samples for each alphabet from  each user in the dataset, 4 samples are considered for training the model  (totalling 1920 images). Remaining 2 samples for each alphabet from  each user is considered for testing in recognition phase (totalling 960  images). Since PCA requires all the vectors to be of same size, all the  images are resized to 50 x 50 dimensions. Before performing training  and testing phases we should undergo through image pre-processing of  the data. Because PCA has been used for recognition on constrained  dataset. While using PCA on real data is difficult to get better  recognition rates. For this purpose, we need a pre-processing step in the  training and recognition phase of the PCA model. The images are  processed and then are used for training and recognition. Smoothing and  contrast enhancement of images are the processing steps that are  proposed to be done. Some image processing techniques like wiener  filter, sober filter, histogram equalisation and Gray input images, the resulting images are used for the training and  recognition phases of the PCA model.  

In the training phase, we take fingerspelling images as input and  apply any of the discussed pre-processing techniques to the training  images. We then transform the training images into column vector by  appending the columns in the image consecutively. Also, build the data  matrix A of image column vectors with label vector L having the  corresponding alphabet names of the image columns in A. We can get  mean column vector M of the data matrix A and subtract mean M from  each of the columns of A to result in mean centered matrix A. After that  we compute the covariance matrix C of A as C = A x ATand obtain the  eigen vectors matrix E and eigen values vector V of C. We rearrange the  eigen vector columns in E as the corresponding eigen values in V are  sorted in descending order. Finally, project the centered matrix A onto E  to get feature matrix P = ETA. With this the training phase ends. 

In the recognition phase, the image I to be recognised is converted to  1-D vector form J similar to that in training phase and is projected on to  the eigen space to get Z where Z = XTJ and the Euclidian distance  measure d between Z and all the projected samples in P is computed,  

d = dist (Z Pk) = ||Z – Pk||. 

The sample label k of the sample in P with minimum d is taken as  the recognised label of Z. During recognition, various dimensions (m)  can be considered for computing the Euclidian distance measure.  Recognition rate is defined as the ratio of successful recognition of  sample image to the number of samples used for testing in recognition  phase. Results of the experiments are with various image processing  techniques are as below:

Application of image processing techniques helped in increasing the  performance of appearance-based methodologies for fingerspelling  recognition. Techniques like smoothing and contrast enhancement using  wiener filter, extended sobel filter, histogram equalisation techniques  and a novel Gray levels reduction technique are applied resulting in  much improvement in performance of PCA.

For further increasing the performance other methods like 2D PCA,  (2D)2 PCA and Diagonal PCA can be used. Hence, we conclude that  using image processing techniques on appearance-based methods like  PCA gives good results and can be used for Sign language (finger  spelling alphabets) recognition purpose.
